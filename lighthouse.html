                <h4>The current 29-metre-high (95 ft) lighthouse was built in 1952 after the Old Colombo Lighthouse was deactivated when its light became obscured by nearby buildings as part of the Colombo Harbor Expansion project. It was opened by Rt Hon D.S. Senanayake, the first prime minister of Ceylon. Built on a concrete base which is 12 m (39 ft) high, it has four statues of lions at its base.

Due to the panoramic view of the Indian Ocean it offered, it became a city landmark. With the escalation of the Sri Lankan Civil War, public access to the site was restricted. This was due to its placement in a high-security zone as it is across the street from the Naval Headquarters and close proximity of the Port of Colombo.<p>
Gun salute<p>
Located at its base is a naval gun battery that is used by the Sri Lanka Navy for its traditional gun salutes.[2] By tradition the Navy accords a 25-gun salute to the nation on the National day, which is 4 February each year. It began with HMCyS Vijaya of the Royal Ceylon Navy, the first warship of the navy according a 25-gun salute on 4 February 1951 with its single 4-inch gun.

In 1952 two 4-inch guns where brought from the United Kingdom in preparation of the Royal visit of Princess Elizabeth, which did not occur as she returned halfway due to the death of her father the King. Since then the guns are mounted at the lighthouse and fire the gun salute. Three more 52 mm guns were added in 2000 as gifts from the Indian Navy which now fire the gun salutes.</h4>
