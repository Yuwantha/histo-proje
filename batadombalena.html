                <h4>Batadombalena is an archaeological site with evidence of habitation from 8,000 years BCE, Balangoda Man, located 85 km (52.8 mi) from Colombo in Sri Lanka, a two-hour drive from Colombo. The Batadombalena archaeological site contains evidence of habitation from as early as 8,000 years BCE and is one of the sites whose discoveries support the "Out of Africa" hypothesis, according to Professor Paul Mellars, a Cambridge University archaeologist. Among the evidence of Balangoda Man he unearthed at the site were stone tools that are interpreted as arrow - or spearheads and carefully shaped and perforated beads made from ostrich eggshell fragments It is known as Batadombalena, six kilometres from Kuruvita, on the Colombo-Ratnapura road, 86 kilometres from the capital. It is here, 460m above sea level lying in the foothills of Siri Pada that Sri Lankan archaeologists discovered fossil evidence of a prehistoric human settlement of the Balangoda Man, a term forged to refer to the anatomically modern Homo sapiens skeletal remains found in caves near Balangoda.<p>

The discovery of the skeletal remains of the Balangoda Man consolidated the ‘Out of Africa’ theory as propounded by Cambridge University archeologist Professor Pail Mellars, but the detection of the Balangoda Man’s ’tool kit’ and other cultural remains have thrown new light and spurred archeologists to challenge the old view and hold that the Sri Lankan dossier of evidence seems to suggest that modern human beings may have evolved in South Asia, South-east Asia, and perhaps in south China.<p>

Whilst the debate to man’s origins rage afresh in the modern age, the Batadombalena excavations, which unearthed ancient human skeletal fragments and microlithic tools firmly established that a prehistoric human settlement existed in Sri Lanka thousands of years ago. The first excavations done in the late 1930’s led to the discovery of the skeletal remains of several adults and a small child. In 1981, deeper excavations further unearthed a more complete human skeleton and, as the scientists dug even deeper into the seventh soil stratum, more human skeletons and tools emerged to the surface. Carbon dating showed the microlith tools were more than 30,000 years old.<p>

Though the work is far from over, the excavations have stopped now and the place remains desolate. Yet, it still provides a pleasure and a challenge to the intrepid amateur explorer to scale the mount of  Sri Lanka’s apeman and walk upon the same ground the Balangoda Man once trod.</h4>
