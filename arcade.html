                <h4>Independence Memorial Hall (also Independence Commemoration Hall) is a national monument in Sri Lanka built for commemoration of the independence of Sri Lanka from the British rule with the restoration of full governing responsibility to a Ceylonese-elected legislature on February 4, 1948. It is located in Independence Square (formerly Torrington Square) in the Cinnamon Gardens, Colombo. It also houses the Independence Memorial Museum.<p>

The monument was built at the location where the formal ceremony marking the start of self-rule, with the opening of the first parliament by the HRH Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester occurred at a special podium February 4, 1948.

Located at the head of the monument is the statue of the first prime minister of the country Rt. Hon. Don Stephen Senanayake "The Father of the Nation". Most of the annual National Independence Day celebrations have been held here. Apart from a monument it served as the ceremonial assembly hall for the Senate of Ceylon and the House of Representatives of Ceylon until the parliament was moved to the new parliament complex. Currently it is the venue for religious events and annual national day celebrations.<p>The Independence Square was created during a time when Sri Lanka was striving for an ideal. It was built during a time when our nation was searching for an identity -. when we were searching for national pride. ArchWorld speaks to Emeritus professor of Architecture University Moratuwa, Prof. Nimal De Silva on the Independence Square where the fire of independence is rekindled.<p>

After independence in 1948, the government felt that we should have some sort of a memorial to commemorate the independence. Many people proposed many things. Then it was given to the Public Works Department. Sir John Kotelawala at that time decided to recruit one of the best and the brightest. The government realized that there should be something symbolic, something physical that would vitalize and revitalize the minds and hearts of Sri Lankans.<p>

Sir John Kotelawala assembled a team comprising the best Architects and town planners of that era including the chief architect Wynne-Jones, the University architect Shirley D’Alwis, and Olivier Weerasinghe, the Town planner. Venerable Mapalagama Vipulasara thera, the designer of the shrine room and the Buddha Statue at Ananda College, Colombo acted as the designer of the sculptures.<p>

Kotelawala called the chief architect Justin Samarasekera and said – ‘Justin forget about everything, you build something like Magul Maduwa in Kandy.’ When they started doing it, Archt. Justin Samarasekera left the department. Then Wynne-Jones, the first president of the Sri Lanka Institute of Engineers and first president of the Sri Lanka Institute of Architects was asked to take over.<p>

This construction needed to be imposing. It needed to be intimidating in a way. It needed to be larger than life. There needed to be something dignified about it. It needed to make a statement to all who saw it.

“So then they did the concept design and ultimately felt that the building needed to be raised above the ground level and built upon a tall podium to give it a dignified appearance. Space underneath the podium was designed to be an exhibition space. However, this exhibition space built half underground, was below the water table. Consequently, there was water seeping into this semi underground space, and could not be used as an exhibition hall till recent times. Later, with proper waterproofing, this basement was converted to D.S. Senanayake museum,” said De Silva.</h4>
